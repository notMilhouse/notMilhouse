### Hello friend :robot: 
Welcome to my profile,

- :computer: I am a Computer Science student at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo.
- :mag_right: My fields of interest are included in a wide range of subjects, but my real passion lies in computer theory and algorithms.
- :tada: Fun fact: My nick is "notmilhouse" because once a guy told me I ressemble Milhouse from Simpsons, to which I replied "no way, I am not like Milhouse" followed by an eureka moment in my head "so... I am _not Milhouse_", which also fed an identity crisis of course.

If you want to reach me or know more about what I do, check my [website](notmilhouse.github.io).
